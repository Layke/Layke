I'm @Layke!

I have worked in industry at pretty reputable companies such as National Instruments, Watchguard, and Google.

I've also worked in the space race industry at places Blue Origin and Firefly.

Looking to work on open source project, especially RISC-V based hardware systems and help port code to them.

This is the way.
